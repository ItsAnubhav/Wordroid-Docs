In order to fetch the settings from the dashboard, you need to enter the item purchase code that we get from the codecanyon. It is required to sync the latest setting from the dashboard.

1. Go to your WordPress Dashboard
2. Go to WorDroid 4 > Activate Plugin (_located in the sidebar menu_)
3. Enter the item purchase code you get from codecanyon. ([_Get the Item Purchase Code from codecanyon_](https://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/202822600-Where-Is-My-Purchase-Code-))

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you are getting errors like **This purchase code is being used by another user** then double check your wordpress url in the dashboard. Make sure it is exactly the same as it shows in your **WordPress Dashboard > Settings > Site Address (URL)**
