# Notification Settings

To send automatic/manual notification to the app, you need to get the OneSignal REST API Key and the OneSignal App ID that you can get from the OneSignal Dashboard.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that your existing OneSignal App (that is used for browser notification) can't be used in the android app notification. You need to create another OneSingal App for android. You can use the OneSignal app that you are using for WorDroid 3.
{% endhint %}
